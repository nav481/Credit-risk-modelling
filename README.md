Problem Statement <br>

When a financial institute lends money to a customer, they are taking some kind of risk. So, before lending, financial institutes check whether or not the borrower will have enough money in the future to pay back their loan. Based on the customer's current income and expenditure, many financial institutes perform some kind of analysis that helps them decide whether the borrower will be a good customer for that bank or not. This kind of analysis is manual and time-consuming. So, it needs some kind of automation. We are tring to automate this process.<br>
